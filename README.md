## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Installation

1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the table and populate the data you will need to run this app. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. When first opening the app, users can view all of the photos in the gallery. Users can use the scroll bar to see all of the photos.
2. Users can like a photo by clicking on the heart icon.  
3. Users can toggle between each photo and its description by clicking the photo. 
4. Users can add a new photo by entering the photo url and a description in the form at the top of the page. The user will see their new photo at the end of the gallery. 
5. Users can choose to delete a photo by clicking the trash can icon.
